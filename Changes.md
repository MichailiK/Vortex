# Changes between Vortex and this fork
- Changed the prefix to `>`
- Added import command, that allows to import all settings from Vortex using 
the export command.
- Modified premium command, so it doesn't require a guild id & will pick the 
current server as default.
- Modified the about & invite commands
- Removed announce command, as it is useless now that members with @everyone
permissions can mention any role.
- Use different emojis
