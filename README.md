# Vortex

## Discord Moderation Bot
Vortex is a bot designed to keep your server safe and your staff team organized. Its moderation and logging suite keep track of your members and keep your moderators accountable. Its auto-moderator capabilities also allow it to filter out certain types of behavior without need for human intervention, lightening the load on the staff team. Finally, Vortex is designed to be fast and easy to use.

## Can I self-host Vortex?
I wouldn't recommend it. Self-hosting this bot (running a copy yourself) is not supported, and no help will be provided for editing nor compiling the code in this repository. The source code is provided here for transparency about how the bot's primary features work. If you decide to edit, compile, or use this code in any way, please respect the [license](https://github.com/jagrosh/Vortex/blob/master/LICENSE)
